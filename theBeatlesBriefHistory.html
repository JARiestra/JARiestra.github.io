			<h3>Who Were <strong><em><span id="band-name">The Beatles</span></em></strong>?</h3>
			<p>
			John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr; all iconic and well respected names on their own. However, when these talented boys from Liverpool
			<a href="https://youtu.be/45cYwDMibGo" target="_blank"><em>Come Together</em></a>, they form the greatest group of musicans of all time: <strong>The Beatles</strong>. 
			With over 200 songs recorded, 21 of them reaching #1 on  the "Billboard Hot 100" (The most of any band), over 800 million albums sold worldwide, and 8 Grammy Awards 
			recieved; it is hard to imagine anyone who has never heard of these lovable brits! But, in case you haven't heard of this band, here is a short 
			(and I mean <strong>VERY</strong> short) review of them.
			</p>

			<h4>Humble Beginnings</h4>
			
			<p>
			Young, 16 year-old Lennon met Paul McCartney 1957. Lennon, in his band The Quarrymen, had McCartney join the 
			group on guitar. Later the band got George Harrison and original bass player Stuart Sutcliffe to join.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Beatles’ first manager Allan Williams, arranged a residency in Hamburg for the band, which would see original drummer 
			Pete Best join the band. 1961 saw Sutcliffe leave the band – with McCartney replacing him on bass. Following criticism, Best would 
			be also be replaced by Ringo Starr a year later.
			</p>
			<p>
			Following some shows at The Cavern Club, they were discovered by Brian Epstein who would then become the band’s official manager in 1962. 
			Rejected by Decca Records who infamously (and probably regretted) said "<em>We don’t like their sound. Groups of guitars are on the way out</em>", 
			Epstein would have to sign the band to EMI’s Parlophone label and in June initiated their first recording session at Abbey Road Studios.
			</p>
			<p>
			In October of the same year, The Beatles’ first single ‘<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=love+me+do&qs=n&form=EX0023&sp=-1&pq=love+me+do&sc=6-10&sk=&cvid=71CDC4D9659741278675A56BD04A0C11&shtp=GetUrl&shid=5c469887-cbb1-4f1e-9208-bb9488700842&shtk=TG92ZSBtZSBkbyAtIFRoZSBCZWF0bGVzIChIRC1IUSk%3D&shdk=TG92ZSBtZSBkbyAoVGhlIEJlYXRsZXMpLCAxOTYzLiBGdWxsIHZpZGVvIHJlc3RvcmVkIChIRCksIEhRIHNvdW5kLiBiIENhbGRlcnN0b25lIFByb2R1Y3Rpb25zIExpbWl0ZWQuIEx5cmljczogTG92ZSwgbG92ZSBtZSBkbyBZb3Uga25vdyBJIGxvdmUgeW91IEknbGwgYWx3YXlzIGJlIHRydWUgU28gcGxlYXNlLCBsb3ZlIG1lIGRvIE9vaCwgbG92ZSBtZSBkbyBMb3ZlLCBsb3ZlIG1lIGRvIFlvdSBrbm93IEkgbG92ZSB5b3UgSSdsbCBhbHdheXMgYmUgdHJ1ZSBTbyBwbGVhc2UsIGxvdmUgbWUgZG8gT29oLCBsb3ZlIG1lIGRvIFNvbWVvbmUgdG8gbG92ZSBTb21lYm9keSBuZXcgU29tZW9uZSB0byBsb3ZlIC4uLg%3D%3D&shhk=Dx2x45r5ulmrKYq2jLbQ%2BQmUmYmOBBbfoagowQDaMgw%3D&shth=OSH.sTgJiJ4yWRZq5itHJo04eQ" target="_blank">
			Love Me Do</a>’ (written by McCartney at 16) peaked at Number 17 on the Record Retailer chart.
			The band would return to Hamburg for their fifth and final residency before returning home with a new look and a promise to be 
			more serious about their music. Serious they were, as they would go on to release 12 studio LPs in an eight year period.

			<h4>Beatlemania</h4>
			
			<p>
			In 1963, a sharp-suited Beatles would record their first LP Please <a href="https://youtu.be/czw8eqepir8" target="_blank">
			<em>Please Me</em></a>, a roaring success in the UK, peaking at number 1 in the charts. Extensive European tours followed, 
			with thousands of fans filling the streets outside venues on a nightly occurrence. The reaction to the band was dubbed 
			Beatlemania. 1964 saw the ‘British Invasion’, with The Beatles hitting USA for the first time. The Ed Sullivan Show played 
			host to their first US television performance, which was a landmark for the band and was watched by approximately 73 million viewers in the States.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Beatles’ rapid success and growing fanbase in America saw them hold the top five places in the Billboard Top 100, 
			which is still a record to this day. Amongst tours, The Beatles found time to record with A Hard Day’s Night and Beatles 
			For Sale released in the second half of 1964.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Beatles would see continued success in America with the first live music concerts to be held at stadiums, 
			including a show at Shea Stadium to a world record crowd of 55,600 on August 15th 1965. Playing live finally 
			began to take its toll on the band after four years of constant recording, touring and over 1,400 live 
			appearances, with their last performance to the public at Candlestick Park, San Francisco in August 1966.
			</p>

			<h4>The End of The Beatles</h4>
			<p>
				With no plans for further shows, The Beatles took to the studio with a more experimental approach to their music. 
				From late 1966-1970 The Beatles would go on to record and release a further six studio LPs. Following the death 
				of Brian Epstein, cracks in the group’s unity began to show and recording sessions became difficult with members 
				occasionally quitting and returning.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tensions continued to become apparent and their final performance was to be on the rooftops of Apple Corps on 
				Savile Row, January 1969. The worldwide number 1 album Abbey Road followed later in the year, just before The 
				Beatles finally broke up in 1970.
			</p>
			<p>
				Following The Beatles’ break-up, their final studio LP Let It Be was released 
				on May 8th 1970; now regarded a poignant finale for the group which shook the world.
